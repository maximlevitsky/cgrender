material system:
	* refactor material params 
	* implement material loading
	* implement material GUI
	* use Qt for texture loading instead of pngwrapper
	* decouple texture from renderer
	
loader:
	* implement appearence of same group more that once in obj file - MEDIUM
	* fix remaining OBJ bugs
	

transformations:
	* implement camera with fov and skew angles
	* add camera rotation setting to gui, and reset of the rotation
	* implement dynamic depth based on BBOX
	* transformation panel/right menu
	* think and fix adaptive wheel speed
	* think about what to do when object is too close to screen or partially clipped
	which point to take for reference movement (current box/10 is hardcoded)

renderer:
	* get rid of huge vertex cache: 
		run vertex shader when rendering polygon and not ahead. (with small cache)
	* refactor clipping
		fix backface/frontface decisions when polygon is partially clipped
		find a way to do backface test without canonical representations (related to proper clipping)
	* add threads

* gui/misc: 
	* ambient light panel
	* lights panel
	* shadows panel	
	* implement shading mode == none - EASY
	* implement app title consistently - EASY
	* implement render to file
	* add wheel event handler to color chooser to change brighness of whole color
	* add drag-drop of colors for colorchooser
	
* build system:
	* switch to CMAKE
	* build on windows
	* add script to copy files between mac<->linux
