material system:
	* refactor material params 
	* implement material loading
	* implement material GUI
	* use Qt for texture loading instead of pngwrapper
	* decouple texture from renderer
	
loader:
	* implement appearence of same group more that once in obj file - MEDIUM
	* fix remaining OBJ bugs
	* load/save scene settings to file:
		- need to think about current object system
		- also can save modified OBJ file
	
transformations:
	* implement camera with fov and skew angles
	* add camera rotation setting to gui, and reset of the rotation
	* implement dynamic depth based on BBOX
	* transformation panel/right menu
	
	* think and fix adaptive wheel speed + add wheel acceleration support
	
	* think about what to do when object is too close to screen or partially clipped
		which point to take for reference movement (current box/10 is hardcoded)

renderer:
	* add threads
	* optimizations in rasterizer, there are a lot of stuff that can be improved there
	* add proper LOD calculations - having line below seems feasable
	* add tri-linear sampling
	* collect statistics
	* add rendering statistics to GUI

* gui/misc:
	* rethink and fix the rendering of bounding boxes and axes of objects when in seperate object mode
		- need at least to scale axes of objects.
		- also currently axes are not displayed on selected object
		
	* ambient light panel
	* lights panel
	* shadows panel	
	* implement render to file
	* add wheel event handler to color chooser to change brighness of whole color
	* add drag-drop of colors for colorchooser
	* think of undo/redo modes
	
* build system:
	* fix deployment on mac and update README
	* switch to CMAKE
	* build on windows
	* add script to copy files between mac<->linux
	
	
why bison/lex is better that hand made parser even for simple line by line files
	1. automatic error handling
	2. no mess with tokens
	
	
	
renderer threading:

currently we have following global state:
	1. vertical rasterizers - used in drawtriangle and have attributes attached
		only globally
	2. horizontal rasterizer
		set up in drawtriangle but used for lod queries.
		
	3. ps_inputs.
