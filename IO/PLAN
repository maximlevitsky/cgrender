maintain current state:

1. list of vertexes that was read so far, list of vertex normals that was read so far and so on

current object name - empty string by default
current group name - 'default' by default
current material = default material, updated on usemtl
	- on change finish current model and set it to NULL

current model NULL by default
current model hash:
	(v,vn,vt) -> index in vertex model


when seeing a face, do the following:
	if current model == NULL, create new model with
		- current material, object name + group name
		
	- lookup all vertexes in hash of current model and create all new vertexes
	- make first vertex with polygon_ptr == NULL first vertex in the polygon
		- and set there the polygon_ptr
		- if such vetex doesn't exist, clone first vertex.
		
		
		
		
- end of file is like seening a face
